# Gr.12-Culminating-Activity
A Game I made for a gr 12 class.
I made a clone of Geomerty Wars(although I only have circles).
I made this with only minor programming education and certainly no education on good coding style so please excuse the mess.
I have not included the music I used in the game because it was not my own. It was from the PSN game Shatter.
Some snippets of code were from my teacher or from the internet but the overwhelming majority is mine.
